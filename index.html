        <p>My name is Dennis. I am an American enrolled in Japan's Ritsumeikan University.</p>
        <p>Before enrolling in University, I pursued a degree in mechanical engineering in a community college in the American state of Maryland. I founded the Japanese club in this college, and served as its president for two semesters.</p>
        <p>Starting in 2020, I started to learn the Japanese language. I had a profound respect for how peaceful Japanese society is, as well as the cleanliness of the country. In a couple of years, I had progressed in my studies far enough to be able to have written and spoken conversations comfortably. I hope to continue my Japanese studies, and potentially get an N1 certification in the near future.</p>
        <p>Before I came to Japan, I was a senior Taekwondo instructor for 7 years. I was hoping to join a martial arts circle in Ritsumeikan, but there doesn't appear to be one in the Osaka Ibaraki Campus.</p>
        <p>In the future, I would like to make video games. Since coming to Ritsumeikan, I've learned the basics of the Unity engine, and have created a game with a game development circle. This field of work would allow me to focus on what I am passionate about, and to work remotely, and potentially set my own hours if I am successful. Being in a working environment where clients are all around the world would also give me more freedom when choosing where I'd like to live.</p>
