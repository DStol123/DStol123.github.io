      <th width="20%">In this project, I did the majority of the coding (in C#) and scene setup for a game that our group called Space Cart in around two months. This game, put simply, was Mario Cart in space. All movement was acceleration based, and there were items such as boost items, bombs, as well as a black hole.</th>
